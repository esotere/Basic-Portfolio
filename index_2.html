                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
                        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
                        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

                    <p>Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
                        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                        normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', mlaking it look
                        like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
                        as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
                        Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
                        of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
